# AI Reflection

* Include documentation on how and where you used AI to build this app. Where did AI misunderstand navigation?

Unlike the first two applications from Individual Assignment 5, I did not use example 2 from lecture 5 as the base to build all of the screens off of, and I did this because it didn't have a bottom navigation bar between all the screens (excluding smaller detail screens). I also did this because I decided not to use a ViewModel. Instead, I asked the AI (ChatGPT) to make a "general skeleton" of the application and I think this worked out nicely, where it was very beneficial to have an overall structure of the application and the moving parts. I think this caused there to be less issues with the AI understanding what's going in the code because it's working from its own knowledge, so all of the navigation came out fairly fluid without much trouble. There was again, though, a lot of finicking with it because I personally have my own understanding of what the assignment needs while the AI can't understand it as thoroughly so I had to go back and change some aspects of certain pieces of the function that it came up with. Again, I used it to accelerate the development of the application, which again worked out quite well. Slightly tedious aspects of maybe putting together screens became trivial. I also think the AI has a nice way of formatting things with padding and text headers we haven't learned. It handled lots of tedium in general.
