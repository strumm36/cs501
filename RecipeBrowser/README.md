# AI Reflection

* Include documentation on how and where you used AI to build this app. Where did AI misunderstand navigation?

I used AI (ChatGPT) to accelerate the development process of this app. I used the Example 2 code as a starting point (you can see many of the comments remain from it), so I did not need AI for most functionality, but it was useful for menial tasks like creating a data structure for recipes in the viewModel, sample data, and speeding up building some of the screens, especially the form. I definitely find that you generally need to tinker with any AI code, the biggest example being it generally uses remember instead of rememberSaveable. I also find that it gives the best results when you put part of your code in as context so it can figure what to incorporate into it. I think it got a little confused with the navigation and screens, but the app is simple enough that I'm not sure how much of an effect that would have on functionality.
