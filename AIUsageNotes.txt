Individual Assignment 4:

Tool Used: I used ChatGPT for the applications in this assignment, because I did not feel confident with the material since class was canceled, and I felt the class examples and resources online didn't fully help me understand the topics.
Prompts Given/Kept/Discarded: I used it almost entirely for debugging. I didn't record every prompt but I would ask it things like Why is the viewModel not working in the main class in the mainActivity when I was getting errors about composable functions. I kept material provided the funcitonality that I desired, but I also wanted to keep a solid understanding of what I was doing, so I discarded any responses where the AI would just spit out a ton of code at me, since that isn't what I wanted. When I used it, I preferred the small answers with detailed explanations of how to apply it.

Individual Assignment 6:

I used Artificial Intelligence (ChatGPT & Android Studio’s built-in Gemini) in IA6 to fill in gaps of knowledge where certain functionalities were beyond what we’ve gone over in class and to accelerate the development process of these applications in general. The canvas and calculations in the Compass & Digital Level, The game and canvas code in the gyroscope ball game, AudioRecord usage and value manipulation, debugging issues with Google Maps API & location, and the two google maps apps in general used AI liberally for generating and debugging Kotlin & Jetpack Compose code. It was mostly a useful tool but sometimes the AIs offer code with several errors or need to be adapted to fit with the environment of my project. Sometimes they make mistakes like putting white text or lines on a white background or don’t consider certain issues that come up that only a user would be able to notice, or are just very confident about incorrect implementations.
