# LazyColumn with Sticky Headers

Instructions Given:
* Build a contact list grouped alphabetically.
* Use stickyHeader to keep the current letter visible as the list scrolls.
* Provide at least 50 contacts (you may generate sample data).
* Add a “Scroll to Top” floating action button (FAB) that appears only when the user has scrolled past item 10.
* Use animateScrollToItem() with coroutines.
* Upload your code to Git and share the link here. Include README.

## Usage

Run the app and scroll to see the implementation of the LazyColumn, and click the FAB to scroll back up to the top.
